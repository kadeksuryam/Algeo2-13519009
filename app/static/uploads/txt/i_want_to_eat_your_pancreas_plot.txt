The next night, Haruki is watching the news with his family, which reveals that Sakura was stabbed on her way home and that she is dead. He breaks down and does not attend her funeral. Later, he visits her mother and asks for Sakura's diary. Her mother recognizes him, and reveals Sakura left a letter for him.
