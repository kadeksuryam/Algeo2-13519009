My holiday is very fun. I went to my grandfather house with my parents. My grandfather lives in a small rural village.
He taught us how to plant a corn. It was so tiring but after that, grandma cooked us a warm corn soup. It was very delicious. Next holiday, I want to go to my grandparents house again.
